In this project we had give some taks

1. Setup a React Application and authentication process by which user can do Login
   and Signup. 
2. Signed in user will see a small calculator on which he can perform:

   a. Multiplication

   b. Addition

   c. Substraction

   d. Division
   Mange with “states”

3. Logged in user will be able to add “todo items“ and will have the capability to:

   a. Add 

   b. Edit

   c. Delete

   d. Update
   Todo list items. Use redux for maintaining this.

4. Make a page where the logged in user can go and in that page just show dummy
   data from an dummy API 
   Example: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
   And display the data in tabular format. Add sorting and searching on client side.
